Instead of assigning roles for the four of us, we have each worked on every component of the project leading up to the final submission. Creating the environment, writing the notebook and coding the robots behaviors were all equally divided into four so that each group member could contribute. We all have basic or minimal knowledge of Python, allowing us to build off of each other's ideas rather than work independently."

    "We wanted to create a scenario in which **epuck2**, the *thief*, is trying to reach the food source, and **epuck1**, the *police*, tries to prevent this crime from taking place. When the police realizes that the thief is going to steal food from the source, it starts to chase the thief, and the thief starts to run away from the police until it reaches its safe space. In scientific literature, these behaviors can be attributed to the fight-or-flight responses as well as predator-prey behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most species are a part of predator-prey relationships, whether that is by searching for their own sustenance or being victim to it from another (1). Predator-prey behaviors are a foundation of many environments (1) and ignite the fight or flight response in situations of threat. For that reason, understanding these connections offers an approach to replicate these complex behaviors. This has been done in prior robotics research in which robot predators are driven to capture robot prey (2) and their instincts are even leveraged as a mechanism to maintain robots safety (3). Our objective was to simulate these natural behaviors that have been seen in animals and replicated in robotics in a simplistic yet fruitful way. To do so, we have created a scenario that is based off of a ‘human’ interaction that still showcases simple instinctual behaviors found in nature."

To allow the robots to interact with the environment correctly, obstacle avoidance is attached to both robots, leading them to avoid the walls. However, the ePuck that is playing the role of the police is attached with an obstacle avoidance behavior that includes the cups and trees in the environment. Doing so allows for the thief to run away from the police successfully into an area that the police cannot enter."

In terms of the code structure, we encountered errors that led us to simplify our code in order to allow it to perform accordingly and run seamlessly. Additionally, some obstacles were encountered in relation to our ePucks behaviors. For example, the behaviors in the robots were only activated if they were in close proximity to one another, leading us to believe that the code was not working. However, this behavior mimicked natural behaviors in the sense that the prey will only chase the predator if it is sensed within the environment. Another limitation in our method was that there was minimal interaction between the thief, police, and the objects around them. For example, the thief was not being able to take what has been stolen to its home but rather the interaction was limited to the thief eating spheres as a representation of a stealing behavior."

It would also be interesting to incorporate behaviors that depended on the other ePucks actions such as accelerating and avoiding obstacles when the robo-cop is perceived by the sensors. Additionally, adding more ePucks to accompany the thief and the police could create more of a storyline and act as rivaling colonies found in nature."
